# Installation

First, [install Lean]( https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html)

Afterwards, you have two options for installing Lean4ij:
1. Using the IDE built-in plugin system (recommended): `Settings/Preferences` > `Plugins` > `Marketplace` > `Search for "lean4ij"` >
  `Install`. You can also download the beta versions by adding the beta channel `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/beta/list` to the plugin repository via `Manage Plugin Repositories...` in the setting options of the plugin page.
2. Manually: Download the [latest release](https://github.com/onriv/lean4ij/releases/latest) and install it
  using
  `Settings/Preferences` > `Plugins` > `⚙️` > `Install plugin from disk...` For nightly builds go
  to [Actions/build](https://github.com/onriv/lean4ij/actions/workflows/build.yml), find the latest successful run and
  scroll to the bottom.

## Usage

1. Create a new lean project using `lake new example`. Then, open the project in IntelliJ (or any other Jetbrains IDE with the lean4ij plugin).
   - Verify the toolchain by running `lake exe cache get` in the project directory
2. Unicode is supported via live templates, for example typing `\b1<SPACE>` would result in `𝟙`.
3. To display the infoview, open any lean file and click the `∀` at the top toolbar. Otherwise, open find action (Control Shift A) and search for `Lean4 Actions: toggle lean infoview (internal) toolbar visibility`
   - If the infoview or anything else seems to be misbehaving, try clicking the restart button at the top of the infoview
4. Enable goal hints by pressing Control I on the line that you want to see the goal for (Control Shift I to remove). You will see something like this:
   - ![Inlay Hint](.github/media/inlay_hint.png)
5. Toggle a mini infoview that follows your cursor by pressing `Control '`. Use `Control '` to disable
    - ![Goal Popover](.github/media/goal_popover.png)

### Actions

Currently, the following actions are defined, mostly without default shortcut. Add one for them in `Keymap` (like
`Control Shift Enter` for toggle infoview)

| action id                            | action text                                                 | default shortcut |

| RestartCurrentLeanFile               | Lean4 Actions: Restart Current Lean File                    |                  |

| DelInlayGoalHint                     | Lean4 Actions: Delete Inlay Goal Hint                       | Control Shift I  |  
| ToggleMiniInfoView                   | Lean4 Actions: Toggle Mini Infoview                         | Control '         |  

## Settings

Since version 0.0.17 there are some settings available:

- General setting is under `Settings/Preferences` > `Leanguages & Frameworks` > `Lean4`. Available settings are:
    - Enable Lsp Completion: LSP-based completion is supported and enabled by default. It can be toggled
      under `Language Server Settings`. LSP completion is occasionally slow, so this option lets you turn
      it off if needed.
- Enable the native infoview, and timeout for popping the doc
- Enable the external infoview
- Extra css for external infoview. The most relevant I found is changing font-size

The inlay hints related settings are under `Settings/Preferences` > `Inlay Hints` > `textmate`:

- `Show inlay hint for omit type`
- `Show value for placeholder _`

Some color settings are under `Settings/Preferences` > `Editor` > `Color Scheme` >  `Lean Infoview`. It contains color
settings for both the external and internal infoview.

## How this fork differs

This fork builds on upstream [onriv/lean4ij](https://github.com/onriv/lean4ij) with a focus on
native editor integration and stability. The main differences:

**Native Lean 4 syntax highlighting.** Highlighting runs through a native IntelliJ language
(JFlex lexer + Grammar-Kit parser + PSI) instead of relying on LSP semantic tokens alone:
- File-level symbol coloring that distinguishes declarations from usages, tactics, and inline
  code in comments, with a deterministic priority order (`LeanConstReferenceAnnotator`).
- Async `documentSymbol` + definition resolution that classifies project vs. external symbols
  and theorem-vs-def kinds (`LeanSymbolColoringService`).
- Bundled `LeanDarcula` and `LeanDefault` color schemes and a dedicated color settings page.

**Richer editing support.** Enter handler, indentation, code folding, structure view, an
import-sort formatter, typed handler, and spellchecking.

**Multi-package Lake projects.** Each file is routed to the Lean server for its nearest-ancestor
`lakefile`, with per-package servers registered lazily (`LakePackageService`). Single-package
projects behave exactly as before.

**LSP / infoview improvements.** Rich interactive-diagnostic tooltips, Lean-server inlay hints,
completion ranked by prefix-match relevance with item types resolved on focus, and a
`keepServerAlive` behavior that survives workspace-model changes.

**Stability and hardening.** A large review pass fixing resource leaks, EDT-threading violations,
data races, and unbounded caches, plus decomposition of several god-objects and added
characterization tests across the codebase.

## Development

Please check [DEVELOP.md](./DEVELOP.md).

## Known Issues

The plugin is still on an early stage, check [ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md) for known and logged issues,
and [TODO.md](./TODO.md)

## Troubleshooting

- Currently, the plugin seems capable to open the same project with vscode in the same time (Although it may consume
  twice the cpu and memory resources). Try open the project simultaneously in VSC and JB-IDE while troubleshooting.
- Currently, some log is printed in the build window for the progressing file and the url to the external/jcef infoview,
  if something does not work normally, some log there may help.
- There are also detailed logs for the lsp server supported by LSP4IJ via the "language servers" tool window after
  setting the debug/trace level to verbose.
- Some logs are also sent in the standard log file like `idea.log`. For different systems the path of it's the following
  paths, it can also be opened via `Help/Show log in ...` in the menu.
    - (Linux) `$HOME.cache/JetBrains/<Product>/log/idea.log`
    - (Windows) `$HOME\AppData\Local\JetBrains\<Product>\log\idea.log`
    - (Macos) `~/Library/Caches/<Product>/log/idea.log`
- If the IDE is freezing, try check also the `threadDumps-freeze-***` files under the log folder.

For showing debug/trace log, add `lean4ij:all` in `MENU > Help > Diagnostic Tools > Debug Log Settings` and restart,
see [How-to-enable-debug-logging-in-IntelliJ-IDEA](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/SUPPORT-A-43/How-to-enable-debug-logging-in-IntelliJ-IDEA)
